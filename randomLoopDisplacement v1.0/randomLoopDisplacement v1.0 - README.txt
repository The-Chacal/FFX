randomLoopDisplacement v1.0

This preset allows you to automatically move a layer that is a loop - a rain impact for example - at the end of the animation.

The preset adds 5 sliders to your layers and an expression on the position parameter of the selected layers.

You have to set the coordinates inside which the layer is supposed to move and the length of your loop.
